# Donders Citylab

Welcome to the jsPsych Micro-Experiment Template!

This repository provides a basic template for creating Donders Citylab micro-experiments using jspsych. It includes the necessary jsPsych libraries, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file to structure your experiment.

Important: Please do not modify the css file directly. If you require custom styling, please contact the Citylab team.

Structure
The repository contains the following files and folders:
Experiment_template.html: The main HTML file where the experiment is embedded.
jspsych/dist: Contains the jsPsych JavaScript files.
img: Stores images used in the experiment.
css: Contains the CSS file for styling.

Getting Started

Open the project: Open the project in your preferred code editor (recommended: Visual Studio Code).
Modify the Experiment_template html file: Use the jsPsych plugins to create your desired experiment. If there are plugins not listed in the template but they are available on jspsych. Please get in contact with the Citylab team and we'll add it to the css file.
Add your images: Place any necessary images or other stimuli in the img folder.
